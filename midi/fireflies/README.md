First try working with the new MIDI controller

Animation is hooked up to a midi controller with knobs and faders

* Color can be controlled with one fader or three knobs (R,G,B) depending on the setting passed in
* Color level can be controlled with a slider
* Pixel count can be controlled with a slider
* Width can be controlled with a slider
* You can use a slider to slow the animation down by inserting a delay in the step functon
